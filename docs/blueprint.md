## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Violet (#7950F2) to create a sense of intelligence and stability.
- Background color: Light grayish violet (#F0EEFA), subtly desaturated, same hue as the primary.
- Accent color: Sky Blue (#50B4F2), analogous to violet but with lighter saturation, draws the eye and provides energy.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, used for both headlines and body text. Inter offers a modern and neutral look, well-suited for a tech and education focused site.
- Use a clean, well-spaced layout with clear sections and consistent padding to enhance readability.
- Employ flat, vector-based icons in the accent color to represent categories and benefits, ensuring visual clarity and consistency.
- Implement subtle animations such as smooth scrolling and hover effects to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the interface.
